# Documentation

This directory contains project documentation for Akwaaba. The `adr/` subdirectory houses Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) that capture important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences. Additional documentation including guides, technical specifications, and design documents will be organized here as the project grows.
